# MelodyPlayer
Takes a melody and provides frequency estimates for each note and translates the frequencies to MIDI notes that can be played by the computer.

Run MelodyPlayer.m with any wave file for the audioread function. The melody cannot have chords in it as it confuses the frequency estimater.
